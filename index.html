      <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> Working in wealth management has given me the opportunity to help my clients realize the financial outcome of the life decisions that they make today. Having a love for solving real-world problems beginning with my clientele has allowed me to shift my focus towards wanting to solve complex problems for everyday businesses. Much of this can be attributed to learning about the meaningful role technology plays in our everyday lives through obtaining my Associate in Arts, Computer Science and being currently enrolled in a Bachelor's of Science, Business Information Management program at the University of California, Irvine.</p>
            <p>Keep in mind that the most important element is the description of what the projects goals were and how you accomplished them. If needed, each project could have a details page specific to it outlining multiple screenshots and a detailed write-up of your involvement on the project. You can even share the software you used, as well as the programming techniques. For now, you can keep this content light, but the more you can share as this portfolio grows, the better.</p>

            <p>Links to your <a href="https://repl.it/@MatthewLeach/Horizontal-Ruler-with-Graphic" target="_blank">code samples</a> and a brief description can work, too!</p>

            <h2>Jenny's Services</h2>
            <p>This is your opprotunity to list out all of the services that you can provide a client/employer. The key is being able to communicate with others what you can provide that will be useful.</p>

            <p>Just listing programming languages and software names doesn't really give others a true sense of what you can do with them. And don't worry if this is a little daunting because you are just starting out and you don't really know. As you learn new skills, just keep in mind how you'll talk to others about what you know as well as how you'll present this in a portfolio. For now, you could always share a wish list of what you are working towards.</p>
